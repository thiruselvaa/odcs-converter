# Project Organization Summary

## Overview

Successfully reorganized the ODCS Converter project with logical directory structure, comprehensive documentation, and utility scripts. All changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub.

## What Was Done

### 1. Documentation Organization (`docs/`)

Created a comprehensive documentation structure organized by audience:

```
docs/
├── README.md                        # Documentation hub and index
├── development/                     # For developers
│   ├── SETUP.md                     # Environment setup
│   ├── CONTRIBUTING.md              # Contribution guidelines  
│   ├── PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md         # Project organization (NEW)
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md              # System design (planned)
│   └── API.md                       # API reference (planned)
├── testing/                         # For testers
│   ├── TESTING.md                   # Complete testing guide (NEW - 676 lines)
│   ├── TEST_FIXES_SUMMARY.md        # Recent test improvements
│   └── COVERAGE.md                  # Coverage reports (planned)
├── deployment/                      # For DevOps (planned)
│   ├── DEPLOYMENT.md
│   ├── DOCKER.md
│   └── CONFIGURATION.md
└── user/                            # For end users (planned)
    ├── USER_GUIDE.md
    ├── CLI.md
    └── EXAMPLES.md
```

### 2. Scripts Organization (`scripts/`)

Centralized all utility scripts with documentation:

```
scripts/
├── README.md                        # Scripts documentation (NEW - 298 lines)
├── setup_tests.py                   # Initialize test structure (moved)
└── run_checks.sh                    # Quality checks script (NEW - 198 lines)
```
